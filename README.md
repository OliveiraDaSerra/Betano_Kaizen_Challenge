# Betano_Kaizen_Challenge

Your objective is to create a small iOS App in Swift. The application is an upcoming sport events viewer, which allows users to check sport events about to start in the near future.

There will be no backend implementation needed from you, but instead, the app will rely on a mock API serving static data. The endpoint you will need is: https://618d3aa7fe09aa001744060a.mockapi.io/api/sports
and you can find the relevant documentation here.

Required functionality:
● Events should scroll horizontally, each row representing a different sport.
● Users should be allowed to mark an event as a favourite and favourites should appear first in their respective row. You do not need to persist them after the application is killed, marking them volatilely as favourites for a single run is
enough.
● Each event must display a countdown to its starting time.
● Users should be able to collapse and expand events per sport.
● A navigation bar with the app name or a logo must exist.
Feel free to follow it pixel-perfectly, or make tweaks. Entirely up to you. You are free to include any additional features but make sure you have covered the requirements before attempting any improvements. A well engineered feature is always better than two mediocre ones. Your solution will be evaluated based on the requirements listed above, the project structure and software engineering practices.
Below we have included a sample UI, reusing components taken straight out of our apps, just to show you the ropes.
Expected deliverable is an Xcode project that can be built and run both in a simulator as well as a physical device and should work on iOS 12 and above.
This feature is inspired by existing functionality in the Stoiximan/Betano native application, and combines challenges that the team has faced in real day to day tasks,
   
So it is a great opportunity to get a taste of what working on a task in the team can look like.
Good to Know:
● Feel free to use an architectural approach of your preference. Keep in mind that we expect you to be able to justify your choice.
● Don’t worry about supporting a landscape orientation. Portrait mode should be more than enough.
● We do not expect you to customize your UI for iPad support. Focus on phone devices only.
● The expected required time to complete the assignment is around 20 hours.

Submitting your assignment:
It's completely up to you to decide how to deliver the task. GitHub, Bitbucket or any other service that's easily accessible works great. You can also upload it to e.g. Google Drive or Dropbox if that's your cup of tea. Try to avoid email attachments though. Please send us a link where we can access your app.
